            <h5 class="card-title">My Story</h5>
              <p class="card-text">I'm Greg. I am orginally from Seatlle, Washington. I grew up listening to jazz music and always had a fasicination with 
                with playing musical instruments. Although I wasn't anything special athletically I made up for it for it by an intense study of music. 
                I graduated from Cornish College of the Arts in Seattle with a degree in Jazz Performance on Trombone. I've played music all over the world. 
                from Moscow, Idaho to Silkeborg, Denmark. I've played all types of styles. From playing on the street corner to playing in Lincoln Center. I am
                known as a loyal sideman and a strong, singing, frontman. 
              </p>
              <br>
              <p class="card-text"> My leadership skills where honed though my military service. For the past 8 years I have served in the United States Navy. It was during my time in 
                that I found a calling as many different things. I, for five years, was a operational and maintence manager. I am capable of leading large groups 
                and meeting metrics on specific deadlines under extreme pressure. I am a trained instructor for the navy. I have taught everything from painting navy ships
                to operating heavy machinery and high speed boats.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p class="card-text">
                Although the navy has given me so much I am motivated to move on and suceed elsewhere. I have a love for computers. I am moving forward with learning to 
                code so I can take another step into cyber security and building computer networks. 

                Life is nothing but a series of small sucesses. I am looking forward to expanding my techical knowledge and suceed with you.
              </p>
